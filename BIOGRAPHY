My name is Makoto Yuan, I'm enrolled at Boston University currently working towards a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering/Computer Engineering/Electrical Engineering (Currently Mechanical Engineering, but may be subject to change). Roughly six years ago I stumbled upon a golden book entitled "C++ for Dummies" in my friend's dark and dingy basement; it was stained dark with water damage, and smelled of dog, but it a tomb of knowledge for myself. I smuggled it to my home where I installed devc++, and eagerly flipped through the pages. I tried to comprehend the complexities that were "cout", and "loops", and started on my first program, "test adventure". It was an awful, poorly coded, and simple text adventure, which had roughly 1 minute of gameplay time (And people complained about portal having a short story). Throughout high-school I took several computer programming courses, where I learned some Java, and more c++. In the first semester of my Freshmen year I took at Java programming course which gave me a strong foundation in Java. Currently I'm teaching myself SQL, PHP, and I'm brushing up on C++ for a videogame project a few friends and I are planning.
